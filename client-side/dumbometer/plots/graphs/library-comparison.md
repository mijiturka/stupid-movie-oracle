# Plotly

aka plot.ly, plotly.com

* starts a server on localhost to display the graph in a browser. turns the server off when finished, so user's left with the served static/javascript page to view the graph.
* seems like it might be using d3.js as a frontend? <!-- TODO -->
* might require the internet? what does it download? <!-- TODO -->

- requires pandas
- works in the same awkward way as matplotlib (almost) - perhaps a wrapper with nicer graphics?

+ graphs are pretty
+ convenient to navigate the graph and take snapshots
